# Shopping Cart Simulator
This is basically my first project with React. I never had contact with the library before, despite already having knowledge about Web Development.

The goal of this project (beyond getting to know better React) is to create a Shopping Cart of a online store.

You have a product, and you can increase it's quantity, as well as delete it from the cart. There is a NavBar displaying the number of products you have in your cart, it only counts products wich have at least one item.

Below you can see a preview of what the app looks like when first opened:

As you can see in the image below, the number of items in the right corner increses as you change the quantities of products in the cart:

You can also reset the cart wich makes every product have zero items:

decrease the product quantity as long as it has at least one:

and remove a product from the cart:
